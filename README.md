# NumberGuessingGameInPython

This game is designed using math & random modules in Python. 

First we ask the user, how many times does he want to play the game.

Then we shall ask the lower and upper limits range.

Now some random integer will be selected in the given range by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses. 

After each guess, the user is intimated if his guess is smaller or larger to the original number.
